Prediction Assignment Writeup
I hope you have a little patience with my tries to use github properly. I usually use other version control tools, so with github,
my experience is very limited. I hope that I master the setup of a gh-page well enough so evaluating my files (Rmd and html) are not
too painful ;-)
Many thanks!
